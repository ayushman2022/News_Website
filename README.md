2. *News Articles Display*: Users can view a list of news articles with headlines, images, descriptions, and publication details.

3. *API Integration*: We integrate with news APIs to fetch real-time news data. This ensures that the content is always up-to-date and relevant.

4. *Search Functionality*: Users can search for specific news articles using keywords or topics.

5. *Filtering and Sorting*: The ability to filter news articles by category, source, or publication date enhances user experience.
